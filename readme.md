hi there!

I'm Chris, and you're looking at my GitHub repository. currently, just about every project featured here is a work in progress, but watch this space for updates in the near future.

you might be interested in:

* [extensions](https://github.com/monster1612/CairoExtensionSamples) for [Cairo Shell](https://github.com/cairoshell/cairoshell/) that I'm incrementally developing;
* my [Python script](https://github.com/monster1612/steal-the-spotlight) that copies images in the Windows Spotlight cache on Windows 10/11 machines;
* an [Apps Script](https://github.com/monster1612/can-it) designed to automatically clear your Gmail spam folder;
* or other projects that I have yet to document...
